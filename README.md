# Binary Dealer (Text/Binary Converter)

## What is Binary Dealer?

Binary Dealer is the first open-source software by J.C.P Laboratory thats converts Text to Binary and vice versa. A Binary digit is a string of eight 0s and 1s, patterned using a base two numbering system used to represent text, numbers, digital data in information and communication devices and everything computer science related. For example the word “computer” in a human readable form known as ASCII is rendered in binary as “01100011 01101111 01101101 01110000 01110101 01110100 01100101 01110010”.
